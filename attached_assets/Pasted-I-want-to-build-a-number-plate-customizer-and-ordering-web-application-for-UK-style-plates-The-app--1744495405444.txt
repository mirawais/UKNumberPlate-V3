I want to build a number plate customizer and ordering web application for UK-style plates. The app should allow users to fully customize their number plates, preview them live, and place orders with payment and shipping details. Admin panel will control pricing, options, and order management.

🎨 Frontend Features
🔹 Left Panel Layout
Includes two tabs:

Road Legal Plates

Show Plates
(Both tabs have the same features)

🔧 Step-by-Step Plate Customization
1. Select Your Options
Instructional text:

"Build your number plate below by choosing from the options and clicking 'Buy Now' to add to basket."

Options:

Both Plates – Shows front (white) + rear (yellow) plates in preview.

Front Plate – Shows only front (white background).

Rear Plate – Shows only rear (yellow background).

🔸 Prices for front and rear are set from the admin panel, e.g. £15 each.

2. Your Registration
User enters number/text for the plate.

✅ Live Preview: The text should update in real-time on the plate preview, just like Demon Plates.

3. Plate Size (Dropdown)
Dropdown populated via admin panel, each option includes:

Name

Size

Additional Price

💰 When a size is selected, its price is added dynamically to the base price (set by admin). Updated total should reflect instantly.

4. Text Style (Dropdown)
On selecting a style:

A popup/modal should appear showing:

Image of text style

Description

📸 Images + descriptions are managed via admin panel.

5. Badges & Colours
Color options (e.g., red, green, blue) will be set by admin via HEX codes.

Badges (e.g., UK, GB flags) will be uploaded by admin as images.

User can pick both color and badge. These apply to the plate preview live.

6. Border
User chooses the plate border color (admin provides color options via HEX).

7. Plate Surround
User can select from a dropdown of car brands (e.g., Ford, BMW, Mercedes).

🔧 Admin will configure:

Brand name

Dropdown options

8. Reset Design
A button outside the frame that clears:

All selections

Entered text

Returns UI to default state

🛒 Buy Now / Checkout System

Customer fills in:

Cash on Delivery (COD)

🛠 Admin chooses which payment methods are available.

Optionally, send confirmation email to user (optional feature)

📝 Tech Notes / Suggestions
Plate preview should be dynamically rendered (SVG or Canvas recommended)

All prices and assets should be loaded dynamically via API or CMS

Admin panel can be built using a custom backend or a headless CMS

Checkout can integrate with Stripe/PayPal SDKs
